# A.P.T (Advanced Persistent Testing)
This project **(WIP)** aims to be a framework composed of modules that allow blue teams to test their threat detection capabilities in their environments by emulating the **Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTP)** followed by an adversary based on [MITRE ATT&amp;CK](https://attack.mitre.org/).

## Installation
### Prerequisites

The following packages are necessary before proceeding to execute the **A.P.T framework**:

* **Python 3.7,** which is installed by default in most operating systems.
* **pywin32:** pip3 install pywin32

## Framework
Currently, **A.P.T framework** is able to emulate the following **TTPs**:

* TA0005 - Defense Evasion
    * T1562 - Impair Defenses
        * T1562.004 - Disable or Modify System Firewall
